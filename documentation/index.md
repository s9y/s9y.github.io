## Documentation overview

We offer several technical documentation files that can be enhanced on our Wiki.

In the section [Installation Docs](/getting-startet/index.html) you will find helpful information covering (shared) installation and Embedding.

The section [User Documentation](/using/index.html) contains information for using and navigating Serendipity. Also see the [Translated Documentations](/localized/index.html) overview for some translations.

For the Geeks and Techies, the [Technical Documentation](/developing/index.html) will prove useful for enhancing Serendipity using its plugin API and Smarty templating.
