## Serendipity stands for

* ### ![](/img/icons/cogs.png) Reliability
  We want to provide a blog engine that users can trust, for which they can get indivdual support, while being able to influence the project (both as users and developers).
* ### ![](/img/icons/stethoscope.png) Security
  The developer team is always mindful of and open to reports on potential security issues. Our track record shows that we have dealt with few issues switfly [over the years](http://www.cvedetails.com/product/3867/S9Y-Serendipity.html?vendor_id=2214).
* ### ![](/img/icons/code-fork.png) Extensibility
  Plugins and themes provide easy ways to add functionality or change the looks of a blog. With the online plugin repository Spartacus they are well organized and easy to install.
* ### ![](/img/icons/magic.png) Ease of use
  We aim to build simple, but powerful as well as understandable interfaces. The same approach is used for our PHP code, which is supposed to have a low entry barrier.
