* ### Trackbacks and Pingbacks
  Serendipity can accept, send and autodiscover trackbacks and pingbacks. You will be noticed when you react to articles in other blogs, and you will be notified when another blogger links to an article of yours. It is not a CMS, but a real Blog.

  A robust plugin system allows you to modify Serendipity without digging through the core source code. Sidebar plugins allow easy customization of your blog with dozens of features. Event plugins can hook into any place in s9y to make it one of the most flexible APIs available.
