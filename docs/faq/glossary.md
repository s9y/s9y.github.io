* [Trackback](#A2)

#### <a name="A2"></a>Trackback

A way for other blogs to let you know they're using your articles. Like a footnote, but in reverse. It is considered polite to provide a link and a trackback to any articles you reference.

Trackbacks can also be used for spam. It's annoying, but true. See [Disabling Trackbacks](spam-protector.html) and [Removing Trackback Links](removing-trackback-links.html) for more information.
