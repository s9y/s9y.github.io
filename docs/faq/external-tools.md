### Interfacing with Serendipity

Serendipity interoperates with many external tools and websites.  Even if the tool doesn't include Serendipity settings, you can usually make it work pretty easily.

[I want to use w.bloggar to create entries.](wbloggar-setup.html)

[I want to use my Flickr images in my Serendipity media library.](flickr-setup.html)

[I want to make my plogger gallery look like part of my Serendipity blog.](plogger-setup.html)

[I want put entries or headlines on a different web page.](showing-entries-elsewhere.html)
