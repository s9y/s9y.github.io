# What kind of display problem?

Stuff looking wrong, eh?  Which most accurately represents your problem:

[The blog screen, or part of the screen, is blank.](blog-is-blank.html)

[Some images are missing.](missing-images.html)

[Some elements are too close, too far, overlapping, or displaying text differently than you expected.](incorrect-formatting.html)
