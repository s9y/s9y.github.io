### Documentation overview

We offer several technical documentation files that can be enhanced on our Wiki.

In the section [Installation Docs](http://docs.s9y.org/documentation/getting-started/index.html) you will find helpful information covering (shared) installation and Embedding.

The section [User Documentation](http://docs.s9y.org/documentation/using/index.html) contains information for using and navigating Serendipity. Also see the [Translated Documentations](http://docs.s9y.org/documentation/localized/index.html) overview for some translations.

For the Geeks and Techies, the [Technical Documentation](http://docs.s9y.org/documentation/developing/index.html) will prove useful for enhancing Serendipity using its plugin API and Smarty templating.
