## Documentation overview

Our documentation is separated into four sections.

The [FAQ](/docs/faq/index.html) collects solutions to questions that get asked often.

Deeper explanations on how to use Serendipity can be found in the [User Documentation](/docs/users/index.html).

Developer can use the [Technical Documentation](/docs/developers/index.html) to learn how to modify all aspects of Serendipity, from developing plugins to changing Smarty templates to changing the core itself.

Finally, [Contributing](/docs/contributing/index.html) explains how to help the project.

In all cases, don't forget that there also is [the forum](http://board.s9y.org/) to get direct help from developers and other users.
